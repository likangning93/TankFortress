TODO
[x] add weapons (basics done... don't actually do any damage yet)
[x] add a terrain generator
[x] rewrite controls system to be more modular -> allow shenanigans
[ ] add "enemy encampment" components
  - should be able to shell or run over camps
  - should be able to spawn with the random terrain... ideally we'd use l-systems, but... eh. maybe just have a few templates
  - camps have:
    - mines - basic done
    - walls - basic done
    - artillery - basic done
      - good projectile motion involves... math
      - wanna just use 45 degree launches? should be "safe"
      - give turret rotation instead of straight flipping [x]
    - magi hut
      - need an element to indicate respawning
[x] add multicamera view - http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/10206/how-can-i-show-split-screen-or-multiple-camera-vie.html
[ ] add health/repair system
    - likely need cannonballs to cause splash damage -> see http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/410711/trigger-in-child-object-calls-ontriggerenter-in-pa.html
    - add a cute little bubbly damage collapse animation [done]
    - implement running over enemies [done]
[x] add respawning
[ ] add "magi" enemies
  - teleport into the tank at predefined spawn points, poof out after casting some fire
  - shoot fireballs all over the place -> cause shenanigans, do internal damage
  - can poof to predefined points around YOU as well
  - spawn from "magi huts" -> respawn slow, re-teleport fast
  - be nice if each magi has a unique teleportation color

Trung: some camera shake and a less-centered camera would be nice

Beta:
[x] decide how to progress
    - enhance inside level, make outside slower and more strategic?
      - add auto-targeting?
      - add repairs?
    - tune outside level to make the game less stressful?
      - make the tank move faster, more immediately?
      - make enemies shoot more slowly? -> probably need that better kinematic...
    - both: add co-op?

- let's go with a more complete platformer level within the tank
- the "outside world" will be VERY big, with platforms, holes, walls of its own
- you will have to get the tank to "run" (rollers) and "jump" (thrusters)
  - drive controls should be in clusters, should also be fully destructible
  - thrusters and controls are clustered front, back, bottom for mid-air maneuvers

- enemies: -> need to be familiar, annoying, but not frustrating
  - tank takes damage from howitzer bombardment, so you should try to keep moving
    -howitzer bombardment indicated with !! icon on screen
  - things inside the tank can kill you -> falling on running treads, fried by thrusters...
    -respawn unlimited, but drops you in central control room

- or... goal is to deliver a pizza within a time limit? no need for howitzers, or enemies in general!
- funny stupid enemies teleport into the tank and mess with controls but otherwise don't do harm?

[x] tighten player controls, make 2-player -> nahhh no 2-player
[x] make tank structure much bigger and more complicated
  [ ] implement scattered drive controls? -> not needed, added some obstacles
  [ ] implement thrusters -> limited fuel, recharges on the ground
  [x] add things in the tank that kill you
[ ] make bigger level
[ ] add timers, GUI

- challenge Shlane posted was to simplify + make the game more platformer
- build a platormer level and make driving the tank well tied to playing the
  platformer game well. how to tie these together?
- problem is that centralized tank controls are the only way driving makes sense
  - why should the tank have multiple control areas?
  - should you have to hop around and fire up different engine areas? Seems complicated...
  - can split "jump" and "move" controls at least, though
  - pick up fuel from enemies you kill inside the tank?
  - another idea was wizards who sabotage the drive system
    - slow tank down, prevent jump execution, mess with controls...
    - freeze rockets while tank is in the air
  - maybe we can still keep the landmines outside?
  - or... how about just having rockets? so braking, thrusting up, etc. involves dashing around?
    - be fun if your weight in the tank also influences flight pattern a little
  - you know, super meat boy has REALLY good small levels
  - maybe take inspiration from that kind of level design?
  - lots of opportunities inside the tank to fall to your death?
  - what if... WHEN THE WHEELS ARE ROLLING THE PLATFORMS ROTATE TOO?!
  - and there's ASSORTED OTHER THINGS THAT KILL YOU?
  - maybe just ONE wizard that poofs around?
