TODO
[x] add weapons (basics done... don't actually do any damage yet)
[x] add a terrain generator
[x] rewrite controls system to be more modular -> allow shenanigans
[ ] add "enemy encampment" components
  - should be able to shell or run over camps
  - should be able to spawn with the random terrain... ideally we'd use l-systems, but... eh. maybe just have a few templates
  - camps have:
    - mines - basic done
    - walls - basic done
    - artillery - basic done
      - good projectile motion involves... math
      - wanna just use 45 degree launches? should be "safe"
      - give turret rotation instead of straight flipping [x]
    - magi hut
      - need an element to indicate respawning
[x] add multicamera view - http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/10206/how-can-i-show-split-screen-or-multiple-camera-vie.html
[ ] add health/repair system
    - likely need cannonballs to cause splash damage -> see http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/410711/trigger-in-child-object-calls-ontriggerenter-in-pa.html
    - add a cute little bubbly damage collapse animation [done]
    - implement running over enemies [done]
[x] add respawning
[ ] add "magi" enemies
  - teleport into the tank at predefined spawn points, poof out after casting some fire
  - shoot fireballs all over the place -> cause shenanigans, do internal damage
  - can poof to predefined points around YOU as well
  - spawn from "magi huts" -> respawn slow, re-teleport fast
  - be nice if each magi has a unique teleportation color

Trung: some camera shake and a less-centered camera would be nice
